Two main data files:

- `grad-students.csv`

This project attempts to use Python to do a statistical and visual analysis of the benefits of getting a graduate degree and identify which industries/majors benefit the most from a graduate degree. Our team decided to focus our analysis on median salary and unemployment rate. We decided to use these 2 variables, because we believe that they best represent the 2 biggest reasons why people get a graduate degree. Those reasons being to make more money, represented by median salary, and to have more opportunities, represnted by unemployment rate. We will attempt to implement the use of pandas, numpy, and stats packages to run descriptive statistics and find any statistical differences in the median salaries and unemployment rates between the graduate and undergraduate data. We will also attempt to implement the use of matplotlib and seaborn to create visuals that aid in our analysis.â€‹
